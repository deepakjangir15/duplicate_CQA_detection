# Duplicate Question Detection for CQA Websites

The project aims to detect duplicate questions from CQA (Community Question Answering) websites such as Quora and Stack Overflow using deep learning models. The project will evaluate the performance of various deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models like BERT and RoBERTa, explore the impact of hyperparameters on the models, compare the performance of deep learning models to traditional machine learning models such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and utilize transfer learning to improve model accuracy.

## Project Objectives

1. Evaluate the performance of additional deep learning models, such as CNNs and Transformer models like BERT and RoBERTa, for detecting duplicate question pairs on CQA websites.

2. Explore the impact of hyperparameters tuning on the performance of existing (LSTM) and new deep learning models, including number of layers, the learning rate, and the batch size.

3. Compare the performance of deep learning models to traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest and SVM, to determine the most effective approach for detecting duplicate question pairs on CQA websites.

4. Use transfer learning to leverage pre-trained language models and improve the accuracy of deep learning models in detecting duplicate question pairs, e.g. fine-tuning BERT for question pair similarity and transfer learning with RoBERTa.

5. Utilize a large chunk of dataset for training and testing the models to improve the accuracy and generalization of the models.

6. Explore advanced feature engineering techniques, such as semantic analysis, topic modeling, and Named Entity Recognition (NER), to improve the accuracy of the models in detecting duplicate question pairs on CQA websites.
